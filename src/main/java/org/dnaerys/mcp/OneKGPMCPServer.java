     * NB. When het/hom are exposed as boolean parameters, LLM (GPT5) understands how to correctly use them,
     *     but its reasoning tends to go sideways.
     *
     *     E.g. for a list of all variants in all samples it asks for a list of all variants and samples first
     *     and then for each variant and each sample it checks whether this particular variant in this particular
     *     sample is het or hom (or doesn't exist).
     *
     *     With separate API calls for het/hom variants (as implemented below), LLM does it better - it asks
     *     for a list of all het and hom variants in a region for each sample.
     *
     *     When the latter method is available with het/hom as boolean parameters, LLMs did not use it and instead
     *     iterated variants one-by-one. Perhaps, depends on context.
